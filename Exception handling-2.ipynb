    "In object-oriented programming, including in languages like Python, exceptions are a way to handle errors and exceptional situations that can occur during the execution of a program. Custom exceptions are classes that you define yourself, extending the base `Exception` class or its subclasses, to represent specific types of errors or exceptional conditions that are relevant to your program's logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why using the `Exception` class (or its subclasses) is important when creating custom exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hierarchy and Organization:** The `Exception` class is the base class for all built-in exceptions in many programming languages, including Python. This class is part of a hierarchical structure of exception classes, forming a tree-like structure. By inheriting from the `Exception` class or its subclasses, your custom exception becomes a part of this organized hierarchy. This makes it easier to categorize and manage different types of exceptions within your codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Consistency:** By extending the `Exception` class, your custom exception inherits essential behavior and attributes from the base class. This includes attributes like `args` (arguments passed to the exception), `__str__()` method (string representation of the exception), and other standard methods used when handling exceptions. This consistency ensures that your custom exception follows the same conventions as built-in exceptions, making it more intuitive for other developers to understand and work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exception Handling:** When you raise an exception in your code, it's often caught and handled by other parts of the program or by the user. By using the `Exception` class or its subclasses, you enable generic exception handling mechanisms to catch and manage these exceptions. For instance, you can use a broad `except` block to catch your custom exception along with other built-in exceptions, allowing you to handle them uniformly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Documentation and Clarity:** When you define a custom exception class that explicitly inherits from the `Exception` class, you're providing a clear indication to other developers that this class represents an exceptional situation in your code. This aids in documentation and code readability, as anyone working with your code can quickly understand the purpose and context of your custom exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Customization:** While you can create your custom base exception class from scratch, extending the existing `Exception` class (or one of its subclasses) provides you with a solid foundation. You can then add your own attributes, methods, and behavior specific to your application's needs. This customization is more efficient than building every aspect of your custom exception from the ground up.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, using the `Exception` class as the base for your custom exceptions enhances code organization, promotes consistency, and ensures your exceptions are caught and handled in a standardized manner. It also aligns with best practices and improves the overall readability and maintainability of your codebase."

If you want to limit the depth of the hierarchy you're printing, you can modify the function to include a depth parameter and add a check to stop recursion beyond a certain depth."

    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [10, 20, 30]\n",

    "\n",
    "Both `KeyError` and `IndexError` are specific cases of failed lookup operations, and they inherit from the `LookupError` class. This common inheritance allows you to catch these exceptions using a common `except` block, or you can choose to handle them separately based on your program's logic. The `LookupError` class helps in organizing and managing these types of lookup-related exceptions in a systematic manner."
